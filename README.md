# Introduction
This Google Cloud Function works with a Fortigate Automation Action to change the network tag of a requested Compute instance to one specified in an environment variable. This function uses Node.js 8 and works by first fetching a list of VMs and sorting through them for the VM with the IP address specified in the Fortigate trigger; it then attaches a network tag (specified in an environment variable) to the VM.

> **Note:** Currently only anonymous GCP functions are supported. It is recommended that you secure your function to prevent unauthorized access.
